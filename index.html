      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hi! My name is Savannah and I am currently a middle school teacher and a student in the Coding BootCamp through UNC Chapel Hill.</p>

      <p>I am originally from Southern California.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I love the beach, camping, hiking, riding bikes, etc. Basically, anything outdoors when the weather is nice. But most of all, I love hanging out at home with my family and pets.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Currently, my dream job is to have a position where I can continue to grow my web development skills, but will also allow me the freedom and flexibility to be at home with my family. Long term, I would love to be a part of a non-profit organization using my skills to help better my community. </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I am currently living in Greensboro, North Carolina. </p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>It is a career that has peaked my interest and I believe the evergrowing tech industry will allow me to keep learning and growing within my career lifetime. I chose to commit to this new career because I believe it will open up more opportunities for me and my family for our future. </p>
